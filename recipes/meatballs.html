        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a recipe that we have modified into our own. We first
            had it with HelloFresh, and then my sister-in-law made it for 
            us with roasted carrots.</p>
        <p>The secret to this recipe is the <a href="aioli.html">aioli</a> that
            goes on the meatballs. It adds some heat, some creaminess, 
            and an extra oomph of flavor.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>ground beef</li>
            <li>soy sauce</li>
            <li>ground ginger</li>
            <li>panko breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>seasonings (onion powder, garlic powder)</li>
            <li>steamed rice</li>
            <li>green onion (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425F.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix ground beef, soy sauce,
                ginger, breadcrumbs, and seasonings.</li>
            <li>Once all the ingredients are fully incorporated, 
                section into evenly sized meatballs.</li>
            <li>Place meatballs on a lined baking sheet (for 
                easy clean-up) and put in the oven for twenty minutes.</li>
            <li>Make the sauce.</li>
            <li>If using green onion as garnish, this is where I like to 
                take the time to cut it.</li>
            <li>Rinse one cup of rice (serving size is 1/2 cup
                per person) and place in InstantPot with 1 1/4 cups of water.</li>
            <li>On high pressure, cook the rice for 5 minutes, letting it sit 
                for five more before releasing pressure.</li>
            <li>Once the meatballs are done, dish rice into bowls, top
                with the meatballs, sauce, and green onion.</li>
        </ol>
