        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A savory, quick, and easy recipe with few ingredients. It goes
            well with steamed rice and <a href="aioli.html">sriracha aioli</a>.</p>
        <p>The trick to this flaked salmon is to cook it slowly,
            and not force the flake. Then, once it's fully cooked & 
            flaked, let it simmer while the sauce cooks down.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 oz flank of salmon</li>
            <li>seasonings (powdered onion, powdered garlic, ground ginger)</li>
            <li>soy sauce</li>
            <li>maple syrup</li>
            <li>sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tbsp of oil in a skillet on medium-high.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is hot, add in the salmon and turn the 
                heat to medium.</li>
            <li>Add all of the seasonings to the salmon. Let the 
                salmon cook on one side for 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the salmon is cooking, add the soy sauce, 
                maple syrup, and sesame seeds to a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Turn the salmon over, and season that side as well.</li>
            <li>After another 3-4 minutes, lightly scrape a spatula
                against the salmon. If it flakes easily, and is cooked 
                all the way through, turn the heat to low.</li>
            <li>Add the sauce to the salmon, stirring so that each 
                piece of salmon is covered in sauce.</li>
            <li>Let the salmon sit in the sauce for 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the salmon to steamed rice, vermicilli noodles, 
                or anything else you think it would be paired well with.</li>
        </ol>
